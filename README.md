# Student-Capstone-Project-Assignment-Gurobi-Implementation
NYU Tandon, Management Science (MG-GY 6103), End Semester Project

## Project:
The effective allocation of students to Capstone projects is crucial for fostering optimal learning
experiences. In this project, we tackled this complex task through a combination of Integer
Linear Programming (ILP) and Goal Programming (GP) techniques. Leveraging the power of the
Gurobi solver, our approach aimed to balance student preferences and project requirements.


## Dataset:
Check the data folder to review the Student responses and Project Requirements excel files.

## How to Run the Notebook:
* Check if the dataset is called correctly in the notebook and run notebook.

## Results:
* Successfully Implemented a Integer Linear Programming Model to allocate the students to the Capstone Projects.

## Future Work:
* This implementation is based on a subset of Student responses, but a further model can be implemented which takes in the entire dataset.
